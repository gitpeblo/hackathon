# Hackathon Dati & AI 2025

This repo contains the files for the Hackathon 2025.

To start working, open `hackathon.ipynb` directly in Google Colab:
- In Colab, go to `File > Open notebook > GitHub`.
- Paste `https://github.com/gitpeblo/hackathon/blob/main/hackathon.ipynb` and open it from the repo listing.

Reminder: you can switch Colab's runtime to GPU under `Runtime > Change runtime type`, but GPU sessions have limited quota and may time out with extended use.
